It is used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).


DESCRIPTION

The Yahoo! Answers topic classification dataset is constructed using 10 largest main categories. Each class contains 140,000 training samples and 6,000 testing samples. Therefore, the total number of training samples is 1,400,000 and testing samples 60,000 in this dataset. From all the answers and other meta-information, we only used the best answer content and the main category information.

The file classes.txt contains a list of classes corresponding to each label. 

The files train.csv and test.csv contain all the training samples as comma-sparated values. There are 4 columns in them, corresponding to class index (1 to 10), question title, question content and best answer. The text fields are escaped using double quotes ("), and any internal double quote is escaped by 2 double quotes (""). New lines are escaped by a backslash followed with an "n" character, that is "\n".
